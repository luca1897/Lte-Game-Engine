/*
This Tutorial is a tutorial for more advanced developers.
If you are currently just playing around with the
engine, please look at other examples first. 
This tutorials shows how to create a custom scene node and
how to use it in the engine. A custom scene node is needed,
if you want to implement a render technique, the 
engine is currently not supporting. For example you can write
a indoor portal based renderer or a advanced terrain scene 
node with it. With creating custom scene nodes, you can 
easily extend the LTE Game Engine and adapt it to your
needs.

I will keep the tutorial simple: Keep everything very
short, everything in one .cpp file, and I'll use the engine
here as in all other tutorials.

To start, I include the header files and use the engine namespace.

/*
Here comes the most sophisticated part of this tutorial: 
The class of our very own custom scene node. To keep it simple,
our scene node will not be an indoor portal renderer nor a terrain
scene node, but a simple tetraeder, a 3d object consiting of 4
connected vertices, which only draws itself and does nothing more.

To let our scene node be able to be inserted into the 
Engine scene, the class we create needs only be derived from the
ISceneNode class and has to override some methods.

	tell the scene manager when it should call the ::render method. For example
	normal scene nodes render their content one after another, while
	stencil buffer shadows would like to be drawn after all other scene nodes. And
	camera or light scene nodes need to be rendered before all other scene 
	nodes (if at all).
	So here we simply register the scene node to get render normally. If we would like
	to let it be rendered like cameras or light, we would have to call
	SceneManager->registerNodeForRendering(this, SNRT_LIGHT_AND_CAMERA);
